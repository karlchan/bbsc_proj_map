Most of the site was sold to a private developer in 2005, but Hogan and an oil-fired power plant were left under state control. The power plant, which had also served the hospital, continued to provide electricity and steam heating to Hogan, even though it was extremely inefficient due its age, lack of upkeep, distance from the load (almost 1 mile), and size. Hogan&rsquo;s energy demands are a small fraction of the former hospital&rsquo;s energy demand, meaning the power plant operated far below its peak capacity. This project included the conversion from dirty #6 heating oil to cleaner burning natural gas and a solar thermal installation.\r\n\r\nThe Wrentham Developmental Center is a state-operated, intermediate-care residential facility with a capacity to serve 361 adults with intellectual disabilities. The facility opened in 1907, comprised of four residential units and a twelve-bed, state-of-the-art acute care medical center. Prior to the recent comprehensive energy project, Wrentham Developmental Center underwent an upgrade in the early 1980&rsquo;s including renovations to the residences as well as the program building.

Nevertheless, CertainTeed remained committed to the project and its potential as a showcase for energy-efficient manufacturing through the economic downturn. Despite project budget pressures and with the help of a $300,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund, which provides state financial assistance to business projects that stimulate economic activity, the facility had its grand opening in September 2012.\r\n\r\nThe primary raw material of the gypsum board manufactured at the Roxboro plant is synthetic gypsum, an engineered byproduct of the nearby power plant that may otherwise be landfilled. This material is made when a byproduct from the flue gas desulfurization process at the power plant is scrubbed, cleaned and filtered, and processed into synthetic gypsum and conveyed directly to the CertainTeed Gypsum plant. The beneficial use of this material helps produce a high quality, highly sustainable wallboard product that ultimately reduces environmental impacts. The proximity to the power plant&mdash;operated by Progress Energy Carolinas, a Duke Energy subsidiary&mdash;played a central role in the decision to locate the CertainTeed wallboard plant in the community because of the material&rsquo;s high purity and ability to reduce carbon emissions by transporting the raw material a short distance by conveyor.\r\n\r\nToday, the Roxboro plant produces the complete offering of 1/2&quot; and 5/8&quot; gypsum wallboard products including CertainTeed&reg;, Easi-Lite&reg;, and M2Tech&reg; brands in regular, fire-rated Type X and Type C. Gypsum wallboard, commonly known as drywall, is a key component in residential and commercial interior construction. CertainTeed Gypsum&rsquo;s Roxboro plant offers a highly sustainable portfolio of products with up to 99% total recycled content, moisture and mold resistance, fire resistance, and lighter weight for improved ergonomics during installation and reduced carbon footprint from outbound transportation. Saint-Gobain is the world&rsquo;s largest gypsum board manufacturer. With plants across the United States and Canada, the company can provide local gypsum materials for homes, schools, hospitals, offices, and retail buildings.\r\n","sector":"Industrial","building_type":"Cement, glass, &amp; other mineral","content_type":"Showcase Project","city":"Roxboro","state":"NC","longitude":"-78.9627624","latitude":"36.4094786","logo_source":null,"feature_image":"https://www6.eere.energy.gov/bbsc/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/features/images/Saint-Gobain%20-%20Roxboro%20.jpg?itok=yauUtwVF","summary":"CertainTeed Gypsum, a Saint-Gobain subsidiary, furthered its commitment to energy efficiency and the Better Plants Challenge by building a 500,000 square foot state-of-the-art gypsum wallboard manufacturing plant in Roxboro, North Carolina.\r\n","sp_partner":"Saint-Gobain Corporation","hide_link":null},{"nid":"265","title":"Schneider Electric: Solar Field and Continuous Energy Efficiency Improvement","content":"Schneider Electric&rsquo;s Smyrna plant manufactures medium voltage switch gear and also houses a design center for engineered-to-order switchgear. In July of 2011, the company completed construction of a 1 MW solar farm, which is specially designed to allow operational voltage to be configured for either 600V or 1000V. By transmitting electricity at a higher voltage, Schneider Electric uses 40 percent fewer parallel connections and reduces the fraction of energy lost to resistance. This capability provides the opportunity for a more efficient solar farm operation, enabling Schneider Electric to further its research and testing of alternative energy.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in April 2013, the Smyrna plant became certified under DOE&rsquo;s SEP program. SEP requires facilities to adopt ISO 50001, the international energy management standard, and demonstrate verified energy performance improvements of at least 5% over a three-year period. Through the adoption of SEP, the company documented an energy intensity improvement of 16% between 2008 through 2011. The company has maintained its robust energy management system since then, yielding additional energy efficiency improvements and is seeking recertification under SEP at the Smyrna plant.\r\n\r\nCombined, as a result of the solar project and energy efficiency measures, the plant&rsquo;s net energy consumption was approximately 30% lower in 2013 than it would have been without taking these actions. The plant has seen a 44.5% reduction in net electricity use, with about 19% of that reduction coming from the solar project and the other 25.5% from energy efficiency projects.

The 12-story building features seven floors of office space leased primarily by federal government tenants, three floors of hotel space, and a ground floor lobby that serves both the office and hotel space.&nbsp; After renewing GSA leases in 2010 and 2011, the building was required to achieve and maintain ENERGY STAR certification by scoring 75 or above on ENERGY STAR&rsquo;s 1 to 100 energy performance rating scale. In 2011, JBG set a goal for the building to achieve LEED for Existing Buildings: Operations &amp; Maintenance certification and in 2014 the company joined the Better Buildings Challenge, renewing its commitment to reduce portfolio-wide energy use by more than 20%.\r\n\r\nThe property team regularly tracked resource consumption metrics in both ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager and Ecova&rsquo;s cloud based platform and initial ENERGY STAR scores for the building were in the mid 50&rsquo;s. When the property established a baseline for energy performance in December 2010 with an ENERGY STAR score of 61, much of the lighting was inefficient T12s, the parking garage was severely over-lit with no controls, the building&rsquo;s chillers were original and extremely inefficient Carrier 19EA 1000 Ton R-12 machines with an efficiency rating of .846 KW/Ton , and no VFDs (variable frequency drives) had been installed.&nbsp; JBG recognized that the building&rsquo;s 45-year-old systems presented a major opportunity for energy savings. They enlisted the help of ThinkEnergy Management to conduct comprehensive energy audits for both the office and hotel spaces. A major renovation of the office portion of the building was completed in 2012, including significant infrastructure and common area upgrades. The property team implemented more than 30 different low- and no-cost energy conservation measures (ECMs) that were identified through the audits. In addition, the building enrolled in a demand response program with Energy Curtailment Service from 2012 to 2015, which helped identify tactics to reduce energy consumption not only during emergency peak demand periods but also from day-to-day operations. The team also partnered with Mach Energy in late 2013 to add real-time energy management capabilities.

The facility treats sanitary waste from three municipalities including Cornell University and Ithaca College and discharges safe water to Cayuga Lake. The facility accepts trucked residuals for bioenergy production in combination with in plant residuals via anaerobic digesters. Approximately 40-50% of electricity used at the plant is generated from the biogas produced.\r\n\r\nIAWWTF is dedicated to reducing its carbon footprint through a series of programs that convert bio gas (methane) to energy. The energy generated through these programs is helping to power plant operations. One of the key components in this effort is IAWWTF&rsquo;s Trucked Residuals Receiving Center (TRRC). In 2014, IAWWTF opened the doors on a next generation TRRC to allow the facility to continue a nearly 30 year history in taking local carbon waste and turning it into bioenergy.\r\n\r\nSince 2012, the facility has been upgrading systems involved in its anaerobic digesters, installing replacement cogeneration equipment (switched from reciprocating engines to microturbines) that increased electrical production from 200kW to 260kW, and upgrading aeration equipment. Via another capital project, the facility rebuilt its existing trucked residuals receiving center. Through these two projects, IAWWTF significantly increased biogas production and reduced overall energy usage.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n","sector":"Industrial","building_type":"Utilities: Water and wastewater treatment","content_type":"Partner Profile","city":"Ithaca","state":"NY","longitude":"-76.50774389999999","latitude":"42.4497255","logo_source":"https://www6.eere.energy.gov/bbsc/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/partners/images/City%20of%20Ithaca%20Seal%20Small%20v2_0.png?itok=zRr3eHYT","feature_image":"https://www6.eere.energy.gov/bbsc/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/features/images/Ithica_logo.png?itok=NHVNCaVp","summary":null,"sp_partner":"Ithaca Area Wastewater Treatment Facility","hide_link":"No"},{"nid":"1647","title":"First Potomac Realty Trust","content":null,"sector":"Commercial","building_type":"Office, Administrative or professional office","content_type":"Partner Profile","city":"Bethesda","state":"MD","longitude":"-77.095037099999999","latitude":"38.9862384","logo_source":null,"feature_image":null,"summary":null,"sp_partner":"First Potomac Realty Trust","hide_link":"Yes"},{"nid":"1649","title":"Food Lion","content":null,"sector":"Commercial","building_type":"Food sales &amp;

We provide physical work environments that foster creativity and productivity and serve a broad roster of dynamic, innovation-driven tenants, including technology, entertainment, digital media and health care companies. Our stabilized portfolio totals over 13.2 million square feet of office properties, all located in the coastal regions of greater Seattle, the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego and residential units located in the Hollywood Submarket of Los Angeles. We are a committed leader in the effort to building and operating environmentally sound properties, which has resulted in wide recognition amongst our peers.\r\n\r\nOur environmental vision is a portfolio that minimizes the environmental impact of the construction and operation of our buildings while maximizing tenant comfort, health and financial returns. Our social vision is a resilient company with a sustainable supply chain that maximizes the health and productivity of both employees and tenants. We will accomplish this by achieving the highest levels of performance in energy and water efficiency, waste management, supply chain management, tenant engagement, human capital development, environmental construction, sustainable building operations, green building certifications, materials selection and community involvement. Further, we are the first North American real estate owner to publicly commit to establishing carbon neutral operations by the end of 2020.&nbsp; We plan to execute on our commitment through aggressive onsite energy conservation and investments in renewable energy, building on the 17% reduction in energy consumption we have achieved since 2010. We achieve these reductions through broad ranging energy programs that span the Kilroy Innovation Lab, the award-winning green leasing program, embedded measurement &amp; verification, a dedicated efficiency budget and more.\r\n\r\nAs a result, our stabilized portfolio has achieved high benchmarks for energy efficiency. At year end 2018, 77% of eligible square footage, encompassing 50 buildings, had achieved ENERGY STAR certification. Further, our development pipeline continues to push the envelope on sustainable development. All of our development projects are built to LEED Platinum or Gold standards and our stabilized portfolio is 63% LEED certified.

We got our start organizing neighborhood-specific responses to address brownouts affecting the Chicago area. From there we invented the concept of hourly electricity pricing programs for residential customers, piloted a program to prove it would work, and then helped pass a law to make it available to everyone in Illinois.&nbsp;From these early successes, we saw that pairing relevant technical solutions and education could improve energy efficiency in a major way, and create benefits for everyone. Next, we partnered with the affordable housing community to use energy efficiency retrofits in apartment buildings as a tool to preserve vital housing stock for working families.\r\n\r\nToday we&rsquo;ve branched out with new programs, but we hold close to our roots. We continue to administer the state&rsquo;s two residential hourly electric pricing programs that we helped create, and we upgrade apartment buildings with quality efficiency retrofits with our partner Community Investment Corporation. We&rsquo;re also working with utilities to develop another innovative rate option&mdash;peak time rebate&mdash;and we retrofit a myriad of building types, from single family homes and smaller apartment buildings to houses of worship and daycare centers.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we now work at the community-wide level to bring efficiency to scale. We administer Energy Impact Illinois, a regional initiative of utilities, government entities, and nonprofit organizations working to create a self-sustaining efficiency marketplace. We partner with contractors to ensure their construction work maximizes energy efficiency gains. We are helping the City of Chicago implement its energy benchmarking ordinance, and we&rsquo;re working with the real estate community to appropriately value energy efficiency upgrades at the point of home sale/purchase.\r\n\r\nSince 2000, we&rsquo;ve grown, moved, and changed our name, but we are still closely affiliated with CNT, a leader in promoting urban sustainability and the more effective use of existing resources and community assets. We&rsquo;re currently working together to incorporate water conservation and flood prevention measures into our building retrofit programs.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, we&rsquo;ve increasingly turned our attention to renewable energy, to make sure the benefits of renewables are accessible to renters and low-income households. Alongside other partners, we&rsquo;re helping Cook County to manage a federally funded effort to ensure that everyone will have the opportunity to directly participate in and benefit from the growth of solar photovoltaic generation through community solar installations.\r\n","sector":"Residential","building_type":"Residential, Single family","content_type":"Partner Profile","city":"Chicago","state":"IL","longitude":"-87.6484146","latitude":"41.8769243","logo_source":"https://www6.eere.energy.gov/bbsc/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/partners/images/elevate.jpg?itok=7Na61In8","feature_image":null,"summary":"We design and implement efficiency programs that lower costs, protect the environment, and ensure the benefits of energy efficiency reach those who need them most.

It services a population of about four million residents and an area of 464 square miles with an annual water demand of approximately 166 billion gallons. The mission of LADWP&rsquo;s Water System is to deliver a dependable supply of safe, quality water to its customers in an efficient and publicly responsible manner. Water quality and reliability is a top priority.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every day, hundreds of LADWP employees work diligently to ensure that customers receive high-quality drinking water. LADWP achieves this by protecting its water sources, using state-of-the-art water treatment processes, prudently maintaining and operating its facilities, and providing vigilant security and monitoring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe LAAFP treats all of the water delivered from the Los Angeles Aqueduct and the California Aqueduct. Water flows into the plant by gravity and undergoes several treatment processes that disinfect and remove impurities from the water.&nbsp; The entering water is screened to remove debris, fluoride is added to promote dental health, followed by ozonation to improve the water&rsquo;s taste and appearance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, flocculation chemicals are added to enhance the removal of particulates in the filtration process.&nbsp; The treated water is filtered through six-foot-deep filters (crushed coal over gravel).&nbsp; In 2014, LADWP added ultraviolet light (UV) treatment to the treatment process. UV treatment produces fewer disinfection byproducts and aids in achieving compliance with current and anticipated water quality regulations. After providing treatment to clean the city&rsquo;s water supply, LADWP utilizes chlorine and chloramine as disinfectants to maintain the quality of the water as it travels through the city&rsquo;s pipelines. In March 2015, LADWP covered the reservoir located at the facility with approximately 96 million shade balls to improve water quality and reduce chlorination requirements. The shade balls also protect water from sunlight-triggered chemical reactions, wildlife, and the elements.\r\n\r\nAs aging equipment has been replaced and in the construction of the new UV plant, LADWP has striven to achieve the highest level of energy efficiency in its equipment choices and design decisions.&nbsp;\r\n","sector":"Industrial","building_type":"Utilities: Water and wastewater treatment","content_type":"Showcase Project","city":"Sylmar","state":"CA","longitude":"-118.4689913","latitude":"34.280167","logo_source":null,"feature_image":"https://www6.eere.energy.gov/bbsc/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/features/images/Los%20Angeles%20Aqueduct%20Filtration%20Plant%20Headworks.jpg?itok=A7X8KvyQ","summary":"The Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) was completed in 1986 and has a treatment capacity of up to 600 million gallons of water per day.&nbsp; In the mid-2000s, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) began a comprehensive modernization of the LAAFP with a long-range program to upgrade and replace aging equipment.&nbsp;\r\n","sp_partner":"Los Angeles Department of Water and Power","hide_link":null},{"nid":"2015","title":"Franciscan Towers","content":"While the ground floor commercial spaces, the TNDC main office, and the TNDC-managed Tenderloin After-School Program (TASP) spaces were quickly repaired and reoccupied, there was significant fire, water, and smoke damage on the upper residential floors and ground floor lobby area.

HVAC costs represented 16% of total plant electrical costs and since the original system was designed for extreme weather conditions, it was oversized and not running at maximum efficiency. Installing VFDs on HVAC units facility-wide ultimately led to a 30-86% reduction in the HVAC system&rsquo;s total energy use, depending on the time and season of year.\r\n\r\nEmployees from the West Virginia plant presented on their VFD project at a company facilities conference, as well as during a monthly internal webinar, and verified a simple payback of less than two years. Toyota&rsquo;s corporate leadership took note of the results and established a 5-year strategy plan to replicate this project to the other Toyota plants; the Kentucky plant is now the fifth Toyota plant to pursue a similar HVAC VFD retrofit.

In alignment with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Better Plants Challenge partnership, Celanese implemented the replacement project with energy efficient boilers instead of simply replacing the existing boiler fleet with boilers of similar capacity. &nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe project resulted in the shutdown of seven coal-fired boilers and two older gas-fired boilers, substantially improving energy efficiency, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and solid waste. While the project was originally motivated by a need to comply with the Boiler MACT and NAAQS, this boiler upgrade project achieves energy savings that go beyond these mandates.\r\n\r\nThe new boiler system has significantly reduced energy demand at the site.&nbsp; With fewer components and a more efficient design, the new boilers have resulted in an estimated 12% reduced site electrical load, which yields total plant-wide annual energy savings of approximately 6% and energy cost savings of just under 19%.&nbsp; This is primarily achieved by the reduction of large, high- horsepower boiler fans and elimination of ancillary equipment such as pulverizers and coal and coal ash conveying and handling equipment. &nbsp;Because the new boilers operate at a positive furnace firebox pressure, whereas the coal-fired boilers required a negative working pressure, the boilers operate with fewer large horsepower combustion draft fans, which significantly reduce boiler electrical load.\r\n\r\nDue to changes in required operating equipment, plant steam demand has also dropped by an estimated 6%.&nbsp; This reduction in steam demand largely resulted from the elimination of an existing boiler feed water heater, which is made possible by the installation of additional heat recovery systems and economizers on the new boilers and additional condensate recovery.&nbsp;The conversion was completed without a total plant outage.\r\n\r\nKeeping the existing coal-fired boilers would have required significant and costly modifications to the existing steam system to be in compliance with Boiler MACT and NAAQS regulations. Beginning in 2011, Celanese scoped and developed a project for five new natural gas-fired boilers to replace the existing boiler system at the Narrows plant.&nbsp; In December of 2014, the first boiler was commissioned, with full commissioning of all five new boilers and shutdown of the old coal-fired boilers completed in March 2015.&nbsp;\r\n","sector":"Industrial","building_type":"","content_type":"Showcase Project","city":"Narrows","state":"VA","longitude":"-80.765271","latitude":"37.3499874","logo_source":null,"feature_image":"https://www6.eere.energy.gov/bbsc/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/features/images/TOW%20lines%20at%20Celanese%20Narrows%20Plant.jpg?itok=lACNVYzR","summary":"In March 2015, Celanese successfully completed a $160 million boiler replacement project at this facility replacing coal-fired boilers with natural gas-fired boilers.\r\n","sp_partner":"Celanese Corporation","hide_link":null},{"nid":"2738","title":"The Pythian","content":"The building will have 40,000 square feet of office and retail space that will house a federally qualified health clinic, a women-owned physical therapy clinic, shared offices for non-profits, and a ground-floor festival public market/restaurant space.&nbsp;\r\n","sector":"Multifamily","building_type":"Multifamily","content_type":"Showcase Project","city":"New Orleans","state":"LA","longitude":"-90.074829500000007","latitude":"29.9535359","logo_source":null,"feature_image":"https://www6.eere.energy.gov/bbsc/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/features/images/The%20Pythian%20pre-construction.jpg?itok=jxwE7OLb","summary":"The historic New Orleans building, constructed in 1909,&nbsp;has been vacant since 2000; this energy efficient rehabilitation project, led by Green Coast Enterprises, ERG Enterprises, and the Crescent City Community Land Trust, will be the first of its kind for the property.\r\n","sp_partner":"Green Coast Enterprises","hide_link":null},{"nid":"2740","title":"University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC)","content":"The University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) is one of the four campuses of the University of Nebraska and the only publicly supported health sciences center in the state of Nebraska.&nbsp; Founded in 1881 as the Omaha Medical College, the college became affiliated with the University of Nebraska in 1902.

Through the ESPC, the City retrofitted two types of lights, cobra heads and decorative lights. Input from the Mayor&rsquo;s Office of Sustainability, Engineering, Police, and the Street Light Division of the Public Works Department were all instrumental in the retrofit selection for its cobra head lights. For the decorative lights, the Florida Public Service Commission did not have tariffs specific for LEDs, thus, the City was able to utilize existing &ldquo;decorative street light agreements&rdquo; with FPL to allow for a reduced tariff due to the reduction in maintenance and energy required for each type of street light.\r\n\r\nThe City chose induction lighting for its decorative street lights. The energy savings on the existing decorative street lights would not have paid for the full fixture replacement for LEDs. The City and the ESCO evaluated all city-owned street lights and selected the type of retrofits from this evaluation. Street light retrofit fixtures were assessed on their availability, type of technology, feasibility cost, and warranty.\r\n\r\nUtility Collaboration\r\n\r\nIn addition, Florida Power and Light (FPL) own and fully maintain lights within the City and bill the City for these lights. The lights are tariffed and the amount is determined by the type of fixture and wattage. Some city-owned and FPL-owned lights are on Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) and Palm Beach County roads. Those FDOT and County roads have different guidelines for lights, but the City is still responsible for paying for their operation. Since (FDOT) and Palm Beach County did not have established standards for LEDs, WPB had to remove those lights from their ESPC project. With the funds that were now available, the City made an agreement with FPL to pay for the retrofits for FPL-owned and maintained lights. This was the first time FPL had allowed LED retrofits to be paid for by a municipality anywhere in their service area. FPL does not allow outside contractors to update their lights. A different type of LED fixture was chosen for FPL retrofits due to timing and newer, tested technology.\r\n\r\nIncremental Steps to Implementation\r\n\r\nWest Palm Beach suggests that&nbsp;other cities considering street light retrofits should&nbsp;progress in stages. Since technological advances are happening rapidly, proceeding in phases allows for evaluation of newly available equipment. It is important to have good communication through this process. West Palm Beach also recommends careful review of the wide variety of light temperatures and footprints in different LED lights, and to keep in mind that the continued adoption of LED street lights nationwide means there will be more consistency in these areas moving forward.\r\n","sector":"Local Government","building_type":"","content_type":"Showcase Project","city":"West Palm Beach","state":"FL","longitude":"-80.053325299999997","latitude":"26.7153474","logo_source":null,"feature_image":"https://www6.eere.energy.gov/bbsc/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/features/images/LED%20Streetlight%20Media%20Event%20%2329219028.jpg?itok=Dijx33bP","summary":"West Palm Beach retrofitted 6,800 streetlights to more&nbsp;efficient LED and induction technologies, reducing energy use 54% and helping&nbsp;achieve both their Better Buildings Challenge goal and reduce municipal GHG emissions 11%.\r\n","sp_partner":"West Palm Beach, FL","hide_link":null},{"nid":"3004","title":"Marye Anne Fox Science Teaching Laboratory ","content":"The Fox Laboratory was the first building at NC State to be funded through a $3.1 billion University and Community College Bond Referendum that was approved by North Carolina&#39;s voters in November 2000.&nbsp; The building is named for Dr. Marye Anne Fox, the first woman to serve as Chancellor of NC State between 1998 and 2004.\r\n","sector":"State Government","building_type":"College or university","content_type":"Showcase Project","city":"Raleigh","state":"NC","longitude":"-78.6381787","latitude":"35.7795897","logo_source":null,"feature_image":"https://www6.eere.energy.gov/bbsc/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/features/images/fox2.jpg?itok=kesuQsf5","summary":"North Carolina was able to annually save $77,000 and reduce energy consumption by 12% by repairing and replacing various HVAC components at this NC State laboratory.\r\n","sp_partner":"State of North Carolina","hide_link":null},{"nid":"3016","title":"Shari&#039;s Café &amp; Pies","content":"Shari&rsquo;s Caf&eacute; &amp; Pies is the largest full-service restaurant&nbsp;chain based in the Pacific Northwest.&nbsp;Founded in 1978, Shari&rsquo;s provides high quality,&nbsp;reasonably&nbsp;priced meals 24&nbsp;hours a day in&nbsp;comfortable surroundings.&nbsp; Shari&rsquo;s has increased its&nbsp;commitment to environmental responsibility over the years.

AlexRenew serves over 320,000 people in the City of Alexandria, Virginia, and parts of Fairfax County. During the past 63 years, its customers have invested almost one billion dollars in water cleaning equipment, facilities, and technology to aid its team of water professionals in cleaning used water to ensure healthier waterways for a sustainable community. Every year, this investment helps AlexRenew remove 99.5% of phosphorous and 95% of nitrogen from Alexandria&rsquo;s used water. In addition to reducing these pollutants, AlexRenew reuses all available resources in our processes to create a sustainable operation that saves energy and reduces greenhouse gases. On average, 6,200 dry tons of organic solids are delivered to 30 farms in 13 Virginia counties, introducing more than 240 tons of nitrogen back into the soil which betters the environment and allows farmers to reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers that are more expensive and environmentally detrimental. AlexRenew captures and reuses more than 95 percent of the methane gas produced during its cleaning process that offsets our purchased natural gas by almost 25 percent. AlexRenew also uses reclaimed water as a replacement product for non-drinking water uses at the facility such as flushing, cleaning equipment, irrigation, heating and cooling, hydraulics, and in its educational water features.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAs part of the Better Buildings, Better Plants Challenge, AlexRenew has pledged to reduce energy usage company-wide by 25% over a 2005 baseline, 24,000 tons of CO2e / year, by 2025. AlexRenew employees pledge to consistently deliver exceptional service to its customers and the community by continuously improving business effectiveness and product quality as it secures the highest cost-effective level of resiliency and sustainability in all areas of its operations. AlexRenew&rsquo;s commitment to a healthier environment is highlighted by several large projects such as having a plantinum level LEED Environmental Center with 450 solar panels, which currently offsets approximately 50% of the building&rsquo;s electrical demand, converting over 600 exterior campus lamps to LED which saves more than 85% of the energy used for campus lighting; installing 25 modern power monitors to evaluate energy usage; implementing energy-efficient processes for cleaning water, and ensuring that any equipment that needs to be upgraded or replaced is energy-efficient.\r\n","sector":"Industrial","building_type":"Utilities: Water and wastewater treatment","content_type":"Partner Profile","city":"Alexandria","state":"VA","longitude":"-77.058301","latitude":"38.797238","logo_source":"https://www6.eere.energy.gov/bbsc/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/partners/images/ALEXRENEW%20LOGO.JPG?itok=uX5u5xcN","feature_image":"https://www6.eere.energy.gov/bbsc/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/features/images/Alexandria_Renew_Logo.jpg?itok=Kqqadn-6","summary":"Alexandria Renew Enterprises (AlexRenew) is one of the most advanced water resource recovery facilities in the United States.

Through GRID Alternatives, they developed a model to make solar PV technology practical and accessible for low-income communities that need the savings and jobs the most, yet have the least access. By taking a broader approach to solar as not just an environmental good but also a real-world solution to a real-world economic problem in these communities, GRID Alternatives is helping to set the stage for large-scale solar adoption nationwide.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, GRID Alternatives was selected by the California Public Utilities Commission to serve as the statewide program manager for its $162 million&nbsp;Single-family Affordable Solar Homes (SASH)&nbsp;incentive program, the country&#39;s first dedicated solar rebate for low-income families. Thousands of California&nbsp;homeowners have gone solar through GRID Alternatives under this groundbreaking initiative in partnership with Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, and we have integrated workforce development into every project.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn 2012, GRID Alternatives launched a national expansion with support from Wells Fargo.

Founded in 1961, EWA provides wastewater treatment service to more than 400,000 residents in northwestern San Diego County covering 123 square miles service area. EWA is owned by six public agencies in a unique arrangement called a Joint Powers Agreement. Under this Agreement, these agencies agree to share in the costs and management of EWA in order to get more economical and high-tech facilities than they could get on their own. The six owners are: the City of Carlsbad, City of Vista, City of Encinitas, Vallecitos Water District, Buena Sanitation District, and the Leucadia Wastewater District. The Encina System includes the Encina Water Pollution Control Facility (EWPCF), the Encina Ocean Outfall (Outfall), and the Agua Hedionda (AHPS) and Buena Vista (BVPS) pump stations.\r\n\r\nEWA is a contract operator of other regional clean water infrastructure facilities for their respective owner members including the Carlsbad Water Reclamation Facility, the Buena Creek Pump Station, and the Raceway Basin Pump Station. Since 1980, Encina Member Agencies have invested over $600 million in the Encina System &ndash; its replacement value is currently estimated at over $370 million. EWA has received over 40 awards for organizational excellence, sustainability, and innovation over the past decade. These accolades reflect the competence of EWA&rsquo;s highly qualified, trained, and certified workforce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recognized EWA as a national leader in green power production since 2011.\r\n\tThe California Water Environment Association named the EWPCF California&rsquo;s &ldquo;Plant of the Year&rdquo; in 2005, 2011, 2013 and 2015.\r\n\tEPA also recognized EWA&rsquo;s Biosolids Management Program as the nation&rsquo;s best in 2006.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2011, EWA created The Energy and Emissions Strategic Plan (Plan) which laid the foundation for EWA&rsquo;s energy management strategies. At this time, EWA committed to achieve a targeted energy self-generation goal of 95 percent of the total EWPCF electrical needs, and 50 percent of the total EWPCF gas needs by the year 2020. Subsequently, EWA has performed several energy optimization and reduction projects, including lining of aeration headers, pump system rehabilitation, etc.&nbsp;In 2015, EWA built an Alternative Fuel Program (AFP) at a cost of $2.9 million, to receive FOG (fats, oils and grease) delivered by a private hauler to increase the production of biogas in the anaerobic digesters, which fuels the existing biosolids dryer.

They are firmly committed to doing all that they can to achieve their 2018 goal, and in June of 2017 a 635 kW solar PV system was added to the roof of Solberg&rsquo;s production facility, which is capable of exceeding 100% of their electricity usage.\r\n","sector":"Industrial","building_type":"Machinery","content_type":"Partner Profile","city":"Itasca","state":"IL","longitude":"-88.030653099999995","latitude":"41.9813654","logo_source":"https://www6.eere.energy.gov/bbsc/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/partners/images/solberg_logo_LRG_0.jpg?itok=a-1tB7W-","feature_image":"https://www6.eere.energy.gov/bbsc/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/features/images/Solberg-Logo-nieuw.jpg?itok=Qu938Mzk","summary":"Solberg Manufacturing, Inc. produces air filtration, separation, and silencing products that are designed to protect machinery and the surrounding environment. \r\n","sp_partner":"Solberg Manufacturing, Inc","hide_link":"No"},{"nid":"4875","title":"Honda North America","content":"Founded in 1948 in Hamamatsu, Japan, Honda opened its first U.S. storefront in Los Angeles, CA, in 1959.

NEW Water is a wholesale provider of services to 18 municipal customers, serving more than 231,000 residents in a 285-square-mile area. NEW Water collects and treats an average of 38 million gallons a day (mgd) from the Green Bay Facility (30 mgd) and De Pere Facility (8 mgd), removing more than 97 percent of its pollutants.\r\n\r\nIn 2015, NEW Water began R2E2, or Resource Recovery and Electrical Energy. This new project represents a change in philosophy for NEW Water: valuing waste as a resource to recover, rather than something to dispose. The project replaces NEW Water&rsquo;s existing solids handling facility and harnesses resource recovery of nutrients and gas for cost savings and environmental benefit. Construction launched in August 2015, with completion expected in 2018.\r\n\r\nThe design includes two anaerobic digesters that will break down biodegradable material in the absence of oxygen, and reduce the volume of material to be processed. Methane gas will be captured and used to produce electricity. In the first year of operation, NEW Water&rsquo;s energy costs are estimated to be reduced by 50%, resulting in an estimated savings of more than $2 million. Greenhouse gas emissions are expected to be reduced by about 22,000 metric tons per year, the equivalent to removing about 15,000 vehicles from the road.
