The Review also highlights notable policy changes, assessments, and research projects that have or will aid Will County in reducing energy and water use or in expanding efforts in the areas of renewable energy.\r\n\r\nThe County continues to use ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager to collect and assess data to measure energy usage. Will County is also looking at new energy data collection techniques, such as sub-metering, to better associate varying demands with associated facility uses, which will enable energy and facility staff members to more accurately target energy efficiency opportunities and better measure the impacts of past efforts.\r\n\r\nWill County completed the construction of its new Public Safety Complex &amp; Sheriff&#39;s Department at the end of 2017, which was awarded $60,000 in utility energy efficiency program incentives for energy-efficient measures taken in the new building&rsquo;s design, construction, and commissioning. This isn&rsquo;t the only energy efficient building coming to Will County. In fall 2020, Will County will complete its first LEED-certified facility. The LEED Gold courthouse will boast a host of sustainable measures, including green rooftops and a rooftop ready for solar panels. Will County is projected to receive nearly $60,000 in utility energy efficiency program incentives for this facility as well. Two smaller new builds, an Emergency Management Agency Vehicle Storage Facility and an Animal Control Facility, will also participate in utility energy efficiency programs for their sustainable design and construction.\r\n\r\nIn 2018, Will County is working to analyze all of its properties rooftops and open spaces solar potential. With a comprehensive and current assessment that illustrates the economic and environmental benefits associated with installing solar PV or solar thermal systems on County properties, Will County Leadership is working to integrate renewable energy into short and long range capital planning.\r\n","sector":"Local Government","building_type":"","content_type":"Partner Profile","city":"Joliet","state":"IL","longitude":"-88.079579800000005","latitude":"41.5267286","logo_source":"https://www6.eere.energy.gov/bbsc/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/partners/images/will-county-logo.jpg?itok=WEZ3_uKK","feature_image":null},{"nid":"141","title":"Wyndham Destinations","content":"Our global presence in 110 countries at more than 200 vacation ownership resorts and 4,300+ affiliated exchange properties distinguishes Wyndham Destinations as the world&rsquo;s largest vacation ownership, exchange and rental company.&nbsp; Each year our team of 25,000 associates delivers great vacations to millions of families as they make memories of a lifetime.\r\n\r\nSince its launch, Wyndham Destinations has invested in exploring and adopting innovative sustainable practices through programs focusing on sustainability across the Company.

The building experienced the ups and downs shared by many historic urban centers in the 1970s and 1980s when the City&#39;s population and economic activity spread out to the suburbs.\r\n\r\n1990 was an important year in the building&#39;s revitalization as the Center again became used as a warehouse, this time for the Tattered Cover, a popular, local bookstore. The first official offices for the Wynkoop Brewing Company, founded by former Denver Mayor and now Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, were also housed in the Center during the late 1990s.\r\n\r\nOther than housing the future Mayor and Governor, the building&#39;s public presence began in earnest in 2004 when the non-profit The Alliance for Sustainable Colorado purchased the building with the intention of creating a multi-tenant nonprofit center focused on community sustainability. The idea was to support Colorado&#39;s sustainability community through high quality and affordable office space and services as well as to serve as an educational outreach center promoting sustainability and the reuse of historic buildings.\r\n\r\nThrough it all, the building&#39;s historic brick and Douglas fir wood beam construction has been retained. The Center&#39;s recent renovation restored many of these historic features to their former glory and unveiled elements that had been hidden behind dropped ceilings and walls for many years.\r\n\r\nThe Center has been fortunate to count the City of Denver as an important partner and supporter through the years. The Alliance has been an active supporter of Denver&#39;s Office of Sustainability (formerly Greenprint Denver), long-standing member of its Advisory Council, and the grateful recipient of many City awards, including the 2007 Mayor&#39;s Design Award.\r\n\r\nFor the Center&#39;s most recent transformation project, the Alliance tapped into the collective wisdom of the Denver&#39;s Office of Sustainability and its wider network in determining the eventual design goals and project vision. The Better Buildings Challenge afforded a valuable opportunity to utilize the visibility of The Alliance Center to showcase the City of Denver&#39;s sustainability resources and initiatives; it is the collective plan and intention that the project will showcase what is possible to other commercial building owners and also connect them to the resources to achieve high performance.\r\n","sector":"Local Government","building_type":"Administrative or professional office","content_type":"Showcase Project","city":"Denver","state":"CO","longitude":"-105.0012604000000067","latitude":"39.7512304","logo_source":null,"feature_image":"https://www6.eere.energy.gov/bbsc/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/features/images/denver-top-img-1.jpg?itok=7ITGHnIT"},{"nid":"205","title":"Hotel Monaco, DC","content":"Additionally, all front-of-house lighting, water fixtures, and comfort equipment had to meet the discerning requirements of hotel management.

In addition, they wish to demonstrate to tax payers their commitment to fiscal responsibility as it relates to operational costs.\r\n\r\nThe City of Gillette is committed to reducing energy consumption 20% by 2020. In order to achieve this goal, the City is exploring a number of initiatives, campaigns, and actions, including the adoption of past pilot projects found effective.\r\n\r\nAs a complement to the commitment to the DOE, the City is participating in the Partnership for Local Action with EPA Region 8. This relationship helped Gillette receive an APPA-DEED grant, with which the City hired a summer intern to perform benchmarking with Portfolio Manager and begin formulating energy efficiency campaigns. In addition, EPA supplied an intern to help the City develop an Energy Action Plan. The Plan will serve as a roadmap in pursuing efficiency actions leading to the achievement of our goal.\r\n\r\nGillette is utilizing Energy Service Companies to conduct feasibility studies in an effort to identify and catalog efficiency opportunities. The City&rsquo;s Sustainability Division has partnered with the Facilities Manager to develop a GIS-based inventory log and depreciation schedule for HVAC assets portfolio-wide. This key step should prove to be a valuable resource as the City begins to budget for retrofits.\r\n\r\nContinuing with the partnership theme, the City is working with the Wyoming State Energy Office and the University of Wyoming to develop funding solutions for area small businesses.

This conventional process proved to be costly, resulting in nearly $1 million per year in fuel expenses alone to test engine reliability.\r\n\r\nBriggs &amp; Stratton engineers uncovered an opportunity to lower their operating cost by capturing the energy output from electric generators used to test the engine line-up. In 2008, Briggs &amp; Stratton partnered with Rockwell Automation to create a first of its kind power regeneration system that would capture the mechanical energy generated during engine testing and convert it into electricity for the plant&rsquo;s consumption.\r\n\r\nExperts from both companies identified custom requirements for the project, and ways to maximize return on investment. A major challenge was that a similar regeneration system did not yet exist, so the Briggs &amp; Stratton-Rockwell team had to design the project essentially from a clean sheet. Due to the high costs of creating such a unique system, the team competed for state funding through Wisconsin&rsquo;s Focus on Energy Program in 2008 and again in 2009.

Despite project budget pressures and with the help of a $300,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund, which provides state financial assistance to business projects that stimulate economic activity, the facility had its grand opening in September 2012.\r\n\r\nThe primary raw material of the gypsum board manufactured at the Roxboro plant is synthetic gypsum, an engineered byproduct of the nearby power plant that may otherwise be landfilled. This material is made when a byproduct from the flue gas desulfurization process at the power plant is scrubbed, cleaned and filtered, and processed into synthetic gypsum and conveyed directly to the CertainTeed Gypsum plant. The beneficial use of this material helps produce a high quality, highly sustainable wallboard product that ultimately reduces environmental impacts. The proximity to the power plant&mdash;operated by Progress Energy Carolinas, a Duke Energy subsidiary&mdash;played a central role in the decision to locate the CertainTeed wallboard plant in the community because of the material&rsquo;s high purity and ability to reduce carbon emissions by transporting the raw material a short distance by conveyor.\r\n\r\nToday, the Roxboro plant produces the complete offering of 1/2&quot; and 5/8&quot; gypsum wallboard products including CertainTeed&reg;, Easi-Lite&reg;, and M2Tech&reg; brands in regular, fire-rated Type X and Type C. Gypsum wallboard, commonly known as drywall, is a key component in residential and commercial interior construction. CertainTeed Gypsum&rsquo;s Roxboro plant offers a highly sustainable portfolio of products with up to 99% total recycled content, moisture and mold resistance, fire resistance, and lighter weight for improved ergonomics during installation and reduced carbon footprint from outbound transportation. Saint-Gobain is the world&rsquo;s largest gypsum board manufacturer. With plants across the United States and Canada, the company can provide local gypsum materials for homes, schools, hospitals, offices, and retail buildings.\r\n","sector":"Industrial","building_type":"Cement, glass, &amp; other mineral","content_type":"Showcase Project","city":"Roxboro","state":"NC","longitude":"-78.9627624","latitude":"36.4094786","logo_source":null,"feature_image":"https://www6.eere.energy.gov/bbsc/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/features/images/Saint-Gobain%20-%20Roxboro%20.jpg?itok=yauUtwVF"},{"nid":"265","title":"Schneider Electric: Solar Field and Continuous Energy Efficiency Improvement","content":"Schneider Electric&rsquo;s Smyrna plant manufactures medium voltage switch gear and also houses a design center for engineered-to-order switchgear. In July of 2011, the company completed construction of a 1 MW solar farm, which is specially designed to allow operational voltage to be configured for either 600V or 1000V. By transmitting electricity at a higher voltage, Schneider Electric uses 40 percent fewer parallel connections and reduces the fraction of energy lost to resistance. This capability provides the opportunity for a more efficient solar farm operation, enabling Schneider Electric to further its research and testing of alternative energy.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in April 2013, the Smyrna plant became certified under DOE&rsquo;s SEP program. SEP requires facilities to adopt ISO 50001, the international energy management standard, and demonstrate verified energy performance improvements of at least 5% over a three-year period. Through the adoption of SEP, the company documented an energy intensity improvement of 16% between 2008 through 2011. The company has maintained its robust energy management system since then, yielding additional energy efficiency improvements and is seeking recertification under SEP at the Smyrna plant.\r\n\r\nCombined, as a result of the solar project and energy efficiency measures, the plant&rsquo;s net energy consumption was approximately 30% lower in 2013 than it would have been without taking these actions. The plant has seen a 44.5% reduction in net electricity use, with about 19% of that reduction coming from the solar project and the other 25.5% from energy efficiency projects. Efficiency measures have resulted in another 15% reduction in natural gas usage at the facility.\r\n","sector":"Industrial","building_type":"Electrical equipment, appliances and components","content_type":"Showcase Project","city":"Smyrna","state":"TN","longitude":"-86.49255669999999","latitude":"36.013295300000003","logo_source":null,"feature_image":null},{"nid":"266","title":"ACTION Housing","content":"Founded in 1957, ACTION-Housing, Inc. is a nonprofit that serves southwestern Pennsylvania through a number of programs centered on the provision of decent, safe, and affordable housing.

Examples include the City&rsquo;s curbside recycling program (1993), its resolution to join the Cities for Climate Protection Campaign (2003), a Clean Energy resolution (2005), a membership to Local Governments for Sustainability &ndash; ICLEI (2006), adoption of a Climate Action Plan (2007), designation as a Massachusetts Green Community (2010), and its Worcester Energy program (2012) &ndash; a content-rich website, as well as an education and communication tool.\r\n\r\nFrom 2010 to 2018, the city managed an $80 million energy efficiency and renewable energy project, which was enabled by an Energy Savings Performance Contract (ESPC). &nbsp;The ESPC is a self-funded mechanism that allowed the city to pay for the work through guaranteed energy savings, instead of more limited capital improvement funds. Following a comprehensive energy audit of 171 city facilities in 2009, the city embarked on implementation of a robust suite of recommended energy conservation measures.\r\n\r\nThe ESPC enabled the city to upgrade 92 municipal facilities, most of which were public school buildings. In CY 2016, the measurement and verification report showed that the city saved approximately 66,000 MMBtus of energy, resulting in $1.7M in saved energy costs, which prevented emissions of 7,000 tons of greenhouse gasses.\r\n\r\n2017 was a landmark year for the city&rsquo;s sustainability work. In the summer of 2017, the city installed and began operating the largest municipal-owned solar array in New England &ndash; an 8.1 MW-DC photovoltaic installation on top of a capped landfill. In the winter of the same year, the city completed conversion of its 14,000 streetlight fixtures to energy-efficient and long-lasting LEDs with intelligent controls.\r\n\r\nWhile Worcester is reaping the environmental and financial benefits from the completed projects, it is already in the midst of exploring opportunities to further reduce its energy use.

The 12-story building features seven floors of office space leased primarily by federal government tenants, three floors of hotel space, and a ground floor lobby that serves both the office and hotel space.&nbsp; After renewing GSA leases in 2010 and 2011, the building was required to achieve and maintain ENERGY STAR certification by scoring 75 or above on ENERGY STAR&rsquo;s 1 to 100 energy performance rating scale. In 2011, JBG set a goal for the building to achieve LEED for Existing Buildings: Operations &amp; Maintenance certification and in 2014 the company joined the Better Buildings Challenge, renewing its commitment to reduce portfolio-wide energy use by more than 20%.\r\n\r\nThe property team regularly tracked resource consumption metrics in both ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager and Ecova&rsquo;s cloud based platform and initial ENERGY STAR scores for the building were in the mid 50&rsquo;s. When the property established a baseline for energy performance in December 2010 with an ENERGY STAR score of 61, much of the lighting was inefficient T12s, the parking garage was severely over-lit with no controls, the building&rsquo;s chillers were original and extremely inefficient Carrier 19EA 1000 Ton R-12 machines with an efficiency rating of .846 KW/Ton , and no VFDs (variable frequency drives) had been installed.&nbsp; JBG recognized that the building&rsquo;s 45-year-old systems presented a major opportunity for energy savings. They enlisted the help of ThinkEnergy Management to conduct comprehensive energy audits for both the office and hotel spaces. A major renovation of the office portion of the building was completed in 2012, including significant infrastructure and common area upgrades. The property team implemented more than 30 different low- and no-cost energy conservation measures (ECMs) that were identified through the audits. In addition, the building enrolled in a demand response program with Energy Curtailment Service from 2012 to 2015, which helped identify tactics to reduce energy consumption not only during emergency peak demand periods but also from day-to-day operations. The team also partnered with Mach Energy in late 2013 to add real-time energy management capabilities.

In an effort to mitigate up-front out-of-pocket expenses and administrative burdens for property owners, Placer County solicited a request for qualifications (RFQ) from energy service companies and qualified contractors in order to develop a list of pre-qualified firms to submit bids for the installation of energy conservation measures for the Granlibakken and similar properties. The RFQ asked firms to describe their capabilities to identify, design, install, maintain, and monitor comprehensive energy conservation projects at large commercial facilities within the Lake Tahoe region.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFrom the list of qualified firms that completed the RFQ, Placer County invited three firms to attend a project site visit.&nbsp; Each firm subsequently conducted a free preliminary audit of the facility to identify possible energy conservation measures and to determine an estimated amount of energy savings.

The facility accepts trucked residuals for bioenergy production in combination with in plant residuals via anaerobic digesters. Approximately 40-50% of electricity used at the plant is generated from the biogas produced.\r\n\r\nIAWWTF is dedicated to reducing its carbon footprint through a series of programs that convert bio gas (methane) to energy. The energy generated through these programs is helping to power plant operations. One of the key components in this effort is IAWWTF&rsquo;s Trucked Residuals Receiving Center (TRRC). In 2014, IAWWTF opened the doors on a next generation TRRC to allow the facility to continue a nearly 30 year history in taking local carbon waste and turning it into bioenergy.\r\n\r\nSince 2012, the facility has been upgrading systems involved in its anaerobic digesters, installing replacement cogeneration equipment (switched from reciprocating engines to microturbines) that increased electrical production from 200kW to 260kW, and upgrading aeration equipment. Via another capital project, the facility rebuilt its existing trucked residuals receiving center.
